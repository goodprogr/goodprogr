- 👋 Hi, I’m @goodprogr
👀 I’m interested in the intersection of art and technology, exploring creative ways to merge digital innovation with artistic expression.

🌱 I’m currently learning about interactive media, creative coding, and immersive experiences to push the boundaries of digital art.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on art and technology projects that challenge traditional notions of art and engage audiences in unique ways.

📫 If you're an artist, technologist, or simply share a passion for art and technology, let's connect and create something extraordinary.
